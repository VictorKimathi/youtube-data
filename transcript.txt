Title: here's what it's *really* like building a startup

what day is it today Wednesday Thursday Tuesday Tuesday we got a new video going live in like 20 minutes let's go had some drama unfold yesterday I was integrating slack MD went out integrating slack and I'm like you know what this is going to be a breeze we've already done the o to connect slack to the platform we've already done all the access tokens we've saved them we've hashed them we've made it all work now what we're going to do is just invite the user to the slack workspace by doing some sort of O which I've seen people do with slack before so I was like good all good we'll just get this done like 20 minutes I spun up an o or flow after a couple of hours of debugging it realized actually no you cannot do an O flow the same with slack that you would do with Discord or anything else that's because slack either one requires you to be on an Enterprise plan which is like $8 or $12 us per user imagine if you got like 12,000 people in a slack Community that's just ridiculous and then the second Point as well is that their o flows aren't quite the same as like the way Discord does it either so yeah I've had to figure out a bit of an intermediate solution of how we're actually going to make it work it's a little bit different pretty cool though it actually uses like an OTP you know what I'll just like walk you through it later but had to figure that out and today I'm going to finish up some work on that otherwise we're going to get some coffee first of all o and I've got like four Creator meetings today some big ones as well so yeah we're got to get into that too all right flat [Music] whites back to the den okay it's a priority today the main one is we need to on board these new creators who are coming on to Discord and then I've also got some other meetings where we're going to talk about new Integrations that they want I emailed people last week saying Slack's going to be ready by like the end of this week so I got to get it done okay I actually need to go over whiteboard with this cuz this is wild this is a classic thing in software engineering where you think you've got it down and so you like just start building it and then you realize very fast you do not have down and it's okay cuz as overwhelmed as I was I realized there probably is a solution I just got to figure it out so here we go this is how I thought slack would work the user will click the link come to my landing page or my web app with some sort of token that's also part of that request and then what's going to happen here is we're going to do some sort of check to see are they allowed to do it and if so we're going to redirect them to an o or flow this is a very straightforward kind of process but it just means that we can be in control of the user we can understand whether they're allowed to do whatever they're trying to do and oar and connect to slack and if so yes we'll give them to the Oar and that's going to redirect them back give them some sort of access and we'll throw them directly into the slack that all sounds great right and this is a flow that we use in Discord it's a flow that we're going to use in telegram it's a flow that we're going to use everywhere else and so You' think cool let's just do that let's just build that right now but no slack is very funny when it comes to users on their platform so with slack you've got free workspaces and then you've got paid workspaces and in most cases the paid workspaces are either either going to be for some sort of company or startup or someone where each user is paying $8 to $12 us per user for access to that slack workspace which is ridiculous and so we now have a problem where certain features and very specifically features that I need on the API such as admin invite users or admin accept permissions or whatever those admin endpoints are are only available to Enterprise plans so what that means is I cannot generate invite links it means I cannot programmatically invite users that means I can not programmatically accept invitations to the slack workspace I'm screwed right doesn't make sense so how am I supposed to get people into a slack workspace that we've already authenticated hm I've got to have my own solution and this is what it is and I've got it 95% working so far I just haven't actually wait what was the part that I haven't done I just haven't tested it on iOS I've tested it on web and everything and it works great so this is my flow my custom flow what's going to happen is when a user subscribes and they pay money we're going to send an email to them that contains a public slack invitation link now the way that public slack invitation links work is the user who actually connects their slack in the first place to sub will need to copy that link with no expiration and then those links have a maximum 400 invites on them which is another problem that we have to consider which is so so dumb on slack part but I do understand they're trying to get people to upgrade to Enterprise so now we've got a public invite link public it's got maximum 400 invites that can be added and so now you're probably thinking that doesn't make sense people are going to accept that link they're going to be thrown into the slack but they haven't even paid what if I share the link with my friends exactly my workaround and this is just this is all currently a plan and progress is when a user subscribes they'll get the link they'll jump into the free slack workspace which is going to have one channel which is literally just a welcome Channel now this welcome channel is the only thing they're going to be able to see because all other channels will be private a user subscribes they're going to be sent the free slack workspace invitation which anyone can access by the way it's going to throw them into the slack and there's only going to be one channel available you could send this invite link to all your friends once again importantly another thing to consider there's only 400 maximum invites on that now they're inside the slack there's one channel and inside here there is going to be a verify button now this verify button if you click it it's going to redirect you to a custom page that is for slack oor verification and what's going to happen here there is going to be a page that has a four-digit code or a five-digit code and you're going to enter this special code now where do you get this code from it would have been in the original email that I sent when you first subscribed so there'll be a four-digit code you enter that in here and if it is successful it's then going to load and it's going to throw you back a slack Oar URL and right there it's going to be up to you as the user to click confirm and authorize and so essentially what that's going to do once you authorized then it's going to redirect you back to another page that I have and it's going to take that code it's going to take that state and send it back up to my back end and now we can log on the back end who the user is does that make sense I hope that makes sense anyway let me show you an actual working demo okay so we have a test Community right here we're going to go subscribe we are currently on my Local Host we'll type an email in we'll type a test credit card type a test post post code And subscribe okay cool by the way this is the sub flow if you guys haven't seen it anytime you sign up to SL create a sub this is what it looks like and look at that boom we are in so if we go check out emails we should now have there we go you are in Jacobs community on slack and as you can see have a look at that your verification code is 79 eses so what this means is a user can use this code inside that slack OTP flow to authorize and actually verify themsel into the slack server and based on if it verifies and they are all good to go my slack bot inside that slack workspace is then going to assign that user to all of the private channels that's the flow so let's do that right now first we'll click here to join and this is the public link so we can open Slack and you can see that we are inside the slack and there is currently one channel which you can see is welcome now there are actually more channels in the slack they are all private but there is one link right here which I'm going to click and currently very very ugly design but we currently just have a input box of four digits and so what we're going to do we'll jump back 79 E S so we'll go 7 9 EES okay so as you can see we've actually already authorized with slack that's why it did a fast rir just then but this is what you would see if all went well and right away my bot would throw you into the slack you're already inside the slack but it would assign you those premium private channels so yeah that's the flow so essentially the last thing that I need to do now at this point is tie that last little point when the user o authorizes it goes yep you're good to go and have my bot automatically assign access to those private channels now there's a cool thing as well where we don't necessarily need to assign users to all the private channels cuz look there could be like 50 and they could add them yes inside sub and we can say yes add them all to these channels but we can actually just add them to a few and maybe there's like an announcements Channel a general Channel like all sorts of just like main channels and BAS on that we can actually build custom automations that when a user clicks join this channel it's then going to throw them into a new private Channel and there's actually a ton of third party Bots out there that can do this the main thing is that if someone unsubscribes or their subscription cancels that we want to remove them from every single Channel except the welcome channel so yeah that's another thing to figure out it's currently Tuesday I've said it's going to be live by next week so yeah we have got not a lot of time but that's okay we're going to make it work 8:25 new videos just gone out Dev Club is going wild and uh yeah if you're not already in the dev Club this is actually becoming one of the coolest places very very much so to hang out like this everyone just going wild all day all night if you're not already in the dev Club oh let me give you a quick demo well first of all we've got one big General Channel which is lit literally just theen look there you go we got someone watching the latest video but other than that we've actually got quite a few channels of all sorts of different topics as you can see we've got General code help what I'm working on build ideas setup wins all sorts of different things running accountability let's go into what I'm working on let's see what's going on right here see there's a ton of things that different people are working on we're supporting each other's projects you can see row is launching on product hunt today let's go we've even just created a YouTube creators channel so anyone that's specifically in development and doing like YouTube creation we're talking all about like successful YouTube videos and how to actually make that work so that's super cool as well if you're a developer and you're interested in building projects if you're interested in running interested in cooking interested in disk setups interested in honestly anything to do with the entire development process and actually just like living as a software engineer or someone in Tech definitely check out Jacob's div Club link down below we'd love to have you in there [Music] [Music] all right it is 9:36 I think something that a lot of people don't talk about a lot especially when it comes to like these beautiful Vlogs of day in the life and actually like building stuff is the overwhelm that comes with it and it's very real for me especially um and I mean I think over these past 3 months especially like Madie and I have learned really well how to manage stress anxiety overwhelm and she just like take a second and take a breather and stop doing stuff and then like realize okay actually everything's okay we're healthy we're good but doesn't make it easy and so for example today I have a ton of meetings my calendar is absolutely full I've got creators coming on board for Discord I've got creators coming on board next week for slack I've got creators coming on board for WhatsApp in like couple of weeks I've got so much to do I've got so many different things that come up out of nowhere like bugs and issues and errors and I've got people subscribing to my div club and I want to like give them the best experience and like when I step outside it for a second everything is good but there are definitely times and like for example this morning where I woke up and I was just like man I am just like I just don't feel like getting out of bed right now because there's just so much to do and I know that's just because deep down if I'm being like authentic to myself I'm like just feeling a bit like overwhelmed but actually like if I'm feeling that overwhelmed as probably because there's something like really exciting going on which is we've got a lot of people who are interested we didn't have anyone interested I wouldn't feel overwhelmed at all because there'd be no pressure so it's kind of like a good problem to have but I think it's also having the ability to acknowledge that is like almost the skill in itself I wouldn't say I'm like a you know skillful person in that but like you know it's definitely been something we've been working on and figuring out over the last few months which has been cool so yeah there's a lot going on there's a lot to manage and at times it is like ridiculously overwhelming but it means that we're on to something and there's people that want it over the weekend there's been new people signing up and creating their own Subs which has been super super cool to see and for the like first you know week especially or so was mainly just me and now there's new people jumping in and like if I open my stripe this is really cool I've literally just got like payments and payments and payments and payments if it wants to load of like payments coming through some of them being my de clubs some of them being other people's subs and like different clubs that they're hosting on Discord right now which is super cool and what's really cool as well is every time a payment comes through sub is making money we've got fees coming in and technically right now I'm not even paying myself a salary so can we call this a profitable company to any investors watching we are fully profitable right now but in reality we are going to start paying salar soon we actually just signed a document this morning which is another thing these are all these like things that no one tells you about building a startup there are so so many moving parts that you just never consider because you're just like easy it's literally just Building Product and talking to customers but like that is just one side then there is like paying yourself managing the books managing cash flow managing Runway where am I actually assigning cash flow to go who am I bringing on the team am I even hiring anyone am I bringing medy on what is medy doing what am I doing what are we like where are we overall heading towards there's so so many like factors that is just completely non- Tech related and it's funny because this is like a coding Vlog right and this is like a big like coding Series where we go yeah we're building all this really exciting Tech and there it's like but the reality is half of my brain most of the time is actually caught up in things that aren't even Tech or code related because there is just so so many things to do so anyway it's been great having Maddy on board helping out with so much of the stuff mty's been negotiating how we're going to do the salaries uh when we're not a New York anymore which we can't reveal yet that is coming soon you'll hear about that in a month or so overall if I can say anything and this actually all came because I did notice a comment that came in this morning from this morning's video which said how do you even know what to prioritize or focus on how do you even manage it all I think the reality is I don't you just take it as it comes and you go okay what is going to move the needle right now okay I'm going to head towards that that's kind of how it works yeah I've got meetings this morning I'm doing my slack integration right now I'm slowly making progress and it's just all about making like continuous minimal like momentum forward progress [Music] oh my gosh okay the flow just got 10 times better ignore what I did on the Whiteboard this morning which is still there probably should have cleaned that okay so hear me out before what we were doing is we're getting a user to join the slack and then they would come in that' Click A verify link and then that would send them to my OTP with it into their four-digit code that was in their email and then they would get verified from my server that' be some like backend logic I couldn't get it working in the end just like all the different pieces moving with slack and then you'd have to know what channel it is I've got such a better flow that I've figured out today so what I've done is I've actually enabled socket mode on slack which is this new thing I didn't even realize they do but obviously makes a lot of sense if you're going to be implementing slash commands or anything like that and so what I've done now is when a user installs the bot inside their workspace so like a workspace owner installs the bot everyone will have access to do the slash command verify membership and right there I've what you just saw was me finally oh my gosh finally enabling socket mode so it's like a sec pure connection between my backend specifically just the slack piece and everyone else's slack workspaces so they can SL command into like a four or five or six digigit code that I'm going to give them and then it tells me and my back end everything I need to know about that user what slack workspace they came from what their slack user ID is and then we can check all the membership info we've got their email we got their name I've got everything so like oh my gosh stoked this means that we can just like make the experience so much cooler there's no like separate OTP flow it's literally inside slack stoked so stoked you know what's really cool no one else on Earth is doing this right now I'm going to be the only one wo oh man how good is Tech anyway absolutely fizzing I've got another call with another big YouTube Creator in like 5 minutes so let's get to that feeling good I'm not going to lie I was feeling a little bit worried about the progress we're making so yeah good stuff all right wo we in the booth baby no one can hear me you can what's up guys so tell the people what's your startup what are you building hey guys I'm Brandon I'm building video menus for restaurants and yeah I want to make it bro's taking over New York yes I want to make it so that everyone can see what the food actually looks like the video hell yeah yep dud dude just got a uh got a contract with like all these restaurants in New York he's already got like everything booming wild thank you brother appreciate you sick dude have a good one see you later there's so many different like businesses and like people building stuff that's just so different in here it's really [Music] cool check this out now we're going outside of slack to do any sort of verification do it inh house check this out verif verify membership we'll just do a bogus code please provide a valid verification code oh that's good good to see that's working verify membership and we will use the code we've got one here 79 E S submit that boom you've successfully verified your membership to Jacob test community and then if we just refresh this claimed by slack ID look at that so now we are attributing the slack invites to the correct people so so let's go
